# Reel Maps HackGT 2019
Hack GT 2019:
Bringing the places where your favorite films were made to you!

One of the coolest feelings while watching a movie is recognizing the real-world place where the movie is taking place. With Atlanta's growing filmmaking industry and our own interests in movies, we wanted to curate a map that showed us where movie locations were in real life. Using ESRI's API, we built a map that includes over 5000 movie scenes globally.

But we wanted to go further. We also built an immersive experience where you can watch the film scene overlayed at the exact physical location. If a user is at the location, this will be shown in AR. But if the user is not at the location, we combine a 360-degree panorama of the physical location and overlay the film scene on top.

To watch Spiderman swing through New York _while in New York City_ or watching Princess Aurora emerging out of her actual German castle is sure to bring delight to audiences of all ages. 

From a marketing perspective, this would grow user interest in different movies, as we provide hot links to Amazon pages to purchase the movies. Users will also be able to explore movies filmed nearby their hometown -- who doesn't want to watch a movie shot in their hometown??

Even more specifically, imagine using this technology within Disney World, where kids can watch an animated Cinderella run out of _the Cinderella castle in DisneyWorld_. The possibilities are endless.

We were driven by a want to experience movies in a new way -- making superheroes and princes more real-to-life as ever.
